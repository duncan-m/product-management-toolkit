# product-management-toolkit
Toolkit for entrpreneurs, product managers and product leaders.

It is a set of tools and resources that I reference when I get into new projects/products. They're not all useful all the time but they're pretty helpful a lot of the time. 

## Discovery tools
- Product stakeholder map
- Business model canvas
- Wall of pain
- User story map
- Risk map

## Delivery tools
- Roadmaps (Regular, Readiness, Quarterly)
- Lean feature definition
- Service dependency map
